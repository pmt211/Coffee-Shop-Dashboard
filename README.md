# Coffee-Shop-Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard built using a Kaggle coffee shop sales dataset. It visualizes total sales, quantity sold, top-performing products, seasonal trends, and customer behavior by weekday, time, and price tier.
# Raw Dataset
The raw dataset comprises 3,547 coffee sales transactions, with a total of 9 columns: Hour_of_day,
Cash_type, Money, Coffee_name, Time_of_Day, Weekday / Weekdaysort, Month_name / Monthsort 
# Data Transformation
For a better analysis of the coffee shop's sales and its customers' behavior, I grouped the initial dataset by Coffee type, Weekday, Month, Money, and Time of day to calculate a new Quantity column since the initial data didn't include it. 

An additional column of "Price Tier" was also created to analyze the relationship between the customers' choices of drink and the price.

Other unnecessary columns were deleted.

The final dataset consists of:

**Coffee Name**: Type of coffee purchased (Latte, Americano, Cappuccino, etc.)

**Weekday**: Day of the week of the transaction

**Month Name/Monthsort**: Month of the year of the transaction

**Time of Day**: Time of the transaction

**Money**: Transaction amount (18.12 - 38.7 currency unit) - Here, I assumed the unit to be $

**Quantity**: Number of coffee sold

**Price Tier:** Premium (Money > = 30), Mid (20 < Money < 30), Low ( Money < 20)

# DAX Formulas:

**New Columns:**
- **Revenue**: Sales generated by selling the coffee
  - Formula:
    ```Revenue = [Quantity] * [Money]```
    
- **Season:** Season of the year of the transaction  
  - Formula:

```DAX
Season = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'Coffe_sales'[Monthsort] IN {12, 1, 2}, "Winter",
    'Coffe_sales'[Monthsort] IN {3, 4, 5}, "Spring",
    'Coffe_sales'[Monthsort] IN {6, 7, 8}, "Summer",
    'Coffe_sales'[Monthsort] IN {9, 10, 11}, "Autumn",
    BLANK()
)
```
**New Measures**
- **Average Price per Unit**: Average price per unit of each coffee type
  - Formula:
  ```AVERAGE(Coffe_sales[Money])```

- **Previous Month Sales**: Sales of the previous month
  - Fomula:
    ```
    Previous Month Sales = CALCULATE(
                           SUM(Coffe_sales[Revenue]),
                           FILTER(ALL(Coffe_sales[Monthsort]),
                           [Monthsort] = MAX([Monthsort])-1))
    ```
- **Latest Month Sales**: Sales of the latest month
  - Fomula:
    ```
    Latest Month Sales = CALCULATE(
                         SUM(Coffe_sales[Revenue]),
                         FILTER(ALL(Coffe_sales[Monthsort]),
                         [Monthsort] = MAX([Monthsort])))
    ```
- **Percent growth**: Percent growth of sales based on the previous month
   - Fomula:
    ```
    Percent growth = ( [Latest Month Sales] - [Previous Month Sales] ) /[Previous Month Sales]
    ```
 # Insights and Recommendations
### Product Performance

**Sales concentration:**
- Latte, Americano with Milk, and Cappuccino are the **top sellers**
- These products generate **most of the total revenue**
- Strong preference for milk-based beverages

⇒ **Maintain prime menu placement** and introduce **seasonal versions** (such as flavored, plant-based milks) to sustain and improve performance

**Growth opportunity:**
- Espresso and Cortado currently have **low sales volume** but show **exceptional MoM growth**:
- Espresso: **+300% MoM growth**
- Cortado: **+138% MoM growth**

⇒ Although they are the lowest sellers, the strong growth rate indicates **underleveraged demand**. The coffee shop should not remove them, but instead **promote and increase visibility** to diversify the menu and reduce seasonality risk

### Critical Sales Trend: Major fall from March to April

**The abnormality:**
- The “Sales by Month” chart shows a **sharp decline** from **$15k** in March to **$5k** in April

**Recovery pattern:**
- Sales gradually **recover** over the subsequent months (**May, June, July**)

⇒ This might not be a typical seasonal fluctuation but a **significant business event** that requires **root cause analysis**


### Customer Behavior & Pricing Strategy

**Price preference:**
- Sales are concentrated in **Mid and Premium** price tiers
- **Low-tier** shows minimal sales
- Higher-priced items like **Latte** and **Cappuccino** are also the **top sellers**

⇒ The data shows a clear **correlation between price and sales volume**. It means that customers are **willing to pay more for perceived quality** and indicates a **successful value proposition**

⇒ The business should continue its **value-based pricing** and introduce **add-on upsells** (such as extra shots, specialty syrups) to **increase average ticket size**

**Seasonality:**
- **Autumn** is the **top season** (**29.01%** of units sold)
- The least sales were recorded in **Summer** (**20.6%** of units sold)

⇒ Sales are **relatively distributed fairly year-round**. This suggests **little extreme seasonal fluctuations**

⇒ Launch **targeted seasonal campaigns** (such as summer menu with iced drinks) to **optimize sales year-round**

**Weekday consumption:**
- More orders are made on **Monday and Tuesday**, outperforming the **weekend**
- **Morning and Night** also show the highest demand

⇒ The majority of customers at the coffee shop **buy coffee because of a daily habit**, not primarily for **social or leisure consumption**

⇒ Campaigns like **weekend subscription reductions** and **time-based promotions** (such as running a noon discount program from 3 pm to 7 pm) need to be launched to **boost loyalty and attract more customers during low-demand periods**
