# Coffee-Shop-Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard built using a Kaggle coffee shop sales dataset. It visualizes total sales, quantity sold, top-performing products, seasonal trends, and customer behavior by weekday, time, and price tier.
# Raw Dataset
The raw dataset comprises 3,547 coffee sales transactions, with a total of 9 columns: Hour_of_day,
Cash_type, Money, Coffee_name, Time_of_Day, Weekday / Weekdaysort, Month_name / Monthsort 
# Data Transformation
For a better analysis of the coffee shop's sales and its customers' behavior, I grouped the initial dataset by Coffee type, Weekday, Month, Money, and Time of day to calculate a new Quantity column since the initial data didn't include it. 

An additional column of "Price Tier" was also created to analyze the relationship between the customers' choices of drink and the price.

Other unnecessary columns were deleted.

The final dataset consists of:

**Coffee Name**: Type of coffee purchased (Latte, Americano, Cappuccino, etc.)

**Weekday**: Day of the week of the transaction

**Month Name/Monthsort**: Month of the year of the transaction

**Time of Day**: Time of the transaction

**Money**: Transaction amount (18.12 - 38.7 currency unit) - Here, I assumed the unit to be $

**Quantity**: Number of coffee sold

**Price Tier:** Premium (Money > = 30), Mid (20 < Money < 30), Low ( Money < 20)

# DAX Formulas:

**New Columns:**
- **Revenue**: Sales generated by selling the coffee
  - Formula:
    ```Revenue = [Quantity] * [Money]```
    
- **Season:** Season of the year of the transaction  
  - Formula:

```DAX
Season = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'Coffe_sales'[Monthsort] IN {12, 1, 2}, "Winter",
    'Coffe_sales'[Monthsort] IN {3, 4, 5}, "Spring",
    'Coffe_sales'[Monthsort] IN {6, 7, 8}, "Summer",
    'Coffe_sales'[Monthsort] IN {9, 10, 11}, "Autumn",
    BLANK()
)
```
**New Measures**
- **Average Price per Unit**: Average price per unit of each coffee type
  - Formula:
  ```AVERAGE(Coffe_sales[Money])```

- **Previous Month Sales**: Sales of the previous month
  - Fomula:
    ```
    Previous Month Sales = CALCULATE(
                           SUM(Coffe_sales[Revenue]),
                           FILTER(ALL(Coffe_sales[Monthsort]),
                           [Monthsort] = MAX([Monthsort])-1))
    ```
- **Latest Month Sales**: Sales of the latest month
  - Fomula:
    ```
    Latest Month Sales = CALCULATE(
                         SUM(Coffe_sales[Revenue]),
                         FILTER(ALL(Coffe_sales[Monthsort]),
                         [Monthsort] = MAX([Monthsort])))
    ```
- **Percent growth**: Percent growth of sales based on the previous month
   - Fomula:
    ```
    Percent growth = ( [Latest Month Sales] - [Previous Month Sales] ) /[Previous Month Sales]
    ```
